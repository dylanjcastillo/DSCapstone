# Readme

This repository consists of a report and a predictive text application. The report gives a brief summary of how the application was built. The application is designed to predict the next word the user will input based on a phrase or word previously imputed. The algorithm used for that is called *Stupid Backoff*.

The application was developed as the capstone project for the Data Science Specialization developed by Coursera and Johns Hopkins Univerity.
